Full-stack developer with a flair for clean code, pixel-perfect interfaces, and solving real-world puzzles. I turn ☕ into code, ideas into ecosystems, and bugs into benchmarks. Whether it's crafting tools, curating open source flows—I'm all about remixing complexity into clarity 🚀

- 🎨 Strong frontend instincts — skilled in layout design, color theory, and crafting polished user interfaces using modern frameworks like React, Tailwind and more
- 🔧 Backend proficiency across Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, with deep knowledge of REST APIs
- 🔐 Security-focused — collision resistance and privacy-first development practices
- ⚡ Automation-driven — I streamline repetitive tasks to keep creative momentum flowing
- 🌍 Focused on building open ecosystems that are visually accurate, contributor-friendly, and zero-cost whenever possible

🚀 My go-to tools are: `React`, `Tailwind`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Nodejs`, `Express`, `MongoDB`, `React Native`, `Expo`, `Firebase`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Threejs`, `Vite`, `Git`, `VSCode`, `Figma`, and more.

🧪 I've also used `electron`, `python`, `bash`, and a few extras—handy when the project calls for it, but not part of my core stack.

✨ Let’s build tools that empower creators and make technical setups feel effortless.
